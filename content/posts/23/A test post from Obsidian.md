Testing out writing blog posts directly from Obsidian to my personal website.

We all have different needs and expectations of our digital workspace. As 2022 draws to an end, I have been thinking more and more about these needs for myself and how I can simplify my workflows for the new year. Therefore, I've asked myself:
  What are my needs when it comes to a personal OS?
  Upon reviewing my processes over the past year, how can I simplify them, focusing on the essentials? 
My personal OS needs
  Digital home base
     This is my default app of choice for storing and processing information on a daily basis. It's where my ideas live and ideally where the other aspects of my digital workspace are housed. This tweet from Abraham re-kindled the "digital home base" dilemma for me yesterday. Notion has been my home base from the beginning but over the course of the past year, I realised that this 1 application was not meeting all of my needs, specifically, my task management needs. The all-in-one workspace is ideal because it means that workflows are consolidated in one place and information can be inter-connected seamlessly. I desperately wanted this to be Notion but I had to find a better way to manage my tasks. Now, it's not that Notion is bad for task management, it's great and I've built task managers for people that were a perfect fit for them - it just wasn't for me. This pain point lead me to using (and loving) Sunsama. However, Sunsama was too expensive for me at the time to justify continued use. Enter Tana. From the first time I saw Tana's website and their use case for task management, I fell in love and knew that this would satisfy the pain points that I had with Notion. Because I enter tasks and ideas on a regular basis, Tana slowly began to morph into a home base contender.
  Writing hub 
     My current writing hub is in Notion for the following reasons:
        Good writing interface
        Supports markdown 
        Mobile application with syncing for on-the-go writing 
        Ability to create a kanban board to visualise writing stages
     That being said, I outlined and am currently writing this post in Tana. This is because the ideal writing hub for me is the same application where I store my ideas as it reduces the friction of actually beginning to write.
