Linus Baker follows the rules. With a set daily routine labouring for a strict organization over the majority of his adult life, he has settled for the only life that he knows - a comfortable one devoid of even the smallest of sparks or wonder. As a caseworker for the Department in Charge of Magical Youth, Linus investigates orphanages to determine if they meet the Department’s standards. When Linus is summoned to investigate a particularly high profile orphanage, he begins an adventure that will change the trajectory of his life as he knows it.

This book made my heart feel ever so full. I don’t think I could have asked for a more magnificently heart warming story. I truly wish that I could re-read it again anew and enjoy it’s wonder, humor and joy once again. I laughed (out loud), in almost every chapter, I cried tears of joy and feel fortunate to have been able to read this story.

Side note: This book reminded me of drag queens and drag culture for some reason. Rupaul’s saying, “We’re all born naked and the rest is drag” came to mind.

### Characters
I’ve fallen absolutely and completely head over heels in love with almost every character in this story. This being said, if I had to choose my favourites, I would say Talia for her morbid humour, Chauncey for his genuine (and heart-achingly adorable) dedication to what he loves and Sal for still having room in his heart to open up to those who love him.

### Recommended if:
You want to read a book that makes you smile continuously and feel like there’s still good in the world
You’re feeling for a queer fantasy novel featuring characters with magical abilities
You recently read A Little Life and need hope restored in your life

### Rating
I was quite torn between giving this book 4 or 5 stars. I gave it 4 stars because while it was a beautiful journey, it may have been too perfect. But I suppose that is the purpose of YA fantasy novels.
