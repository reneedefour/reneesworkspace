## Chapter 1: Neuronal Power
The contemporary age is characterized by our inability to appropriately respond to and process an abundance of the Same as opposed to the foreign, immunologically. The threat is no longer external, as it was in the ages of bacteria and viruses. Symptoms of exhaustion, fatigue and suffocation give rise to neurological illnesses such as depression, borderline personality disorder, ADHD and burnout syndrome whose root pathology is that of excess - overproduction, overachievement and overcommunication.

> Harm does not come from negativity alone, but also from positivityâ€”not just from the Other or the foreign, but also from the Same.
