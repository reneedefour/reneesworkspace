### Some very quick and brief thoughts:

- In her writing, Rooney's characters are in the present moment doing one thing and then she has them think retrospectively, starting another narrative. I suppose she does this to add depth and further information to the story but it feels disjointed for me, particularly because it happens so frequently.
- 187 pages in and I think something has finally clicked in this book when Marianne says I don't know why I can't be like normal people. Because normal people don't exist.
- Marriane's relationships are giving me flashbacks to Jude from A Little Life. It's been what, 4 months and the flashbacks are unfortunately still vivid. I apologize for that reference if you, like me, have tried to forget certain parts large chunks of that book.
- I'm reminded of Scenes from a Marriage (2021) - a similar rendition of relationships: complicated, steeped in history and emotion.
