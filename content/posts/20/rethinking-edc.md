My current everyday carry bag is a simple black and white striped tote bag from Society 6. The items that I need to have with me once I leave the house are:

1. Umbrella
2. Wallet
3. Keys
4. Pocketbook
5. Pen
6. Water bottle
7. Phone
8. Kindle
9. Lactaid

Optional items include hand sanitizer and hand cream.

When I do leave the house, I'm usually traveling to the trail for exercise. I would like to have a bag that doesn't hang from my shoulder, has an easily accessible pocket to store traveling money and keys, and that I can use on the trail as well.

I'm looking into purchasing a [Bellroy Sling](https://bellroy.com/products/category/crossbody-sling-bags?sortBy=most_recent). A sling allows for hands free carry and should not be much of a hamper on the trail. I can also remove the items that I don't need on the trail, leaving them in the car before starting (umbrella, pocketbook, pen and kindle).

I've accumulated 3 Bellroy products thus far and I love each one.

- [Tokyo Totepack](https://bellroy.com/products/tokyo-totepack?color=midnight&material=baida_ripstop#slide-0)
- [Wallet](https://bellroy.com/products/hide-and-seek-wallet?color=obsidian&material=leather_rfid#slide-0)
- [Classic Pouch](https://bellroy.com/products/hide-and-seek-wallet?color=obsidian&material=leather_rfid#slide-0)

Their products are durable and have a minimal yet functional design.

Bellroy offers quite a few sling options and I've narrowed them down to the following: 


**[Sling](https://bellroy.com/products/sling?color=melbourne_black&material=fine_weave#slide-0)**

This is their basic sling. The 7L size should hold my bulkier items (umbrella and water bottle) well but I’m wondering if it’s too large for the trail. 

Price $99 USD = $672.00 TTD


**[Lite Sling](https://bellroy.com/products/lite-sling?color=chalk&material=diamond_ripstop#slide-0)**

Lighter means easier to carry on the trail. My two queries with this one are:

The “expandable gusset that self-compresses” doesn’t appear to compress as well as the Sling, giving it a bulkier appearance when worn crossbody. 

The material does not look as premium as the Sling.

Price $85 USD = $577.00 TTD

**[Sling Mini](https://bellroy.com/products/sling-mini?color=melbourne_black&material=fine_weave#slide-0)**

4L capacity looks ideal for the trail when I just need to have the essential items but I’m unsure if this will fit my umbrella and kindle.

Price $89 USD = $604.00 TTD

Of course, now I've also realised that Bellroy has Samsung phone cases and I'm considering one for my S22+. Why did I go exploring their accessories? 20I don't need a new case as my current Otterbox does the job well enough, but their navy blue or “basalt” case looks beautiful.
